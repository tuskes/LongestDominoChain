# LongestDominoChain
LongestDominoChain

I need an objective-c algorithm to find the longest chain of dominoes possible, given a set of randomly picked dominoes. 
The dominoes have face values of 0 to 12. Lowest being 0|0. Highest being 12|12. 
An example of a randomly picked domino set could be [7|4], [11|8], [11|11], [1|0], [4|2], [7|5], [10|8], [7|3], [10|5], [7|2], [9|8], [12|8], [0|0], [11|10]. 

Dominoes may be connect if adjacent halves have the same value. 
Dominoes may be flipped to accommodate a match. 
The longest chain given the example set above (starting with 12) is: [12|8], [8|11], [11|11], [11|10], [10|5], [5|7], [7|4], [4|2], [2|7], [7|3].
